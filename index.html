Adversarial Machine Learning and Cyber Security 

Special Session in IJCNN 2020 

 

Aims and Scope 

Supervised learning problems are one of the most intensively studied problem in machine learning and data mining communities. A fundamental assumption underlying most supervised learning problems is that the training and the test data are generated from the same underlying probability distribution. This assumption underpins both the research and applied “prediction industry.”  However, adversarial attacks are observed in many scenarios which aim to deceive a machine learning model. For example, a spammer may deliberately change the distribution of texts and images in spam emails so that spam filters (which are classifiers) routinely have to be retrained, or otherwise the adversarial distribution changes will cause the spam filter’s performance to deteriorate. As a result, the problem of “Adversarial Machine Learning” has attracted significant interest in the machine learning and data mining community. 

 

In addition, adversarial samples have also been proven very successful in attacking deep learning models. Recent literature show that making small-magnitude subtle changes to image/text/network data can result in significant testing errors in well-trained CNN and DNN models. Since deep learning models are becoming one of the most popular AI technique that is being equipped into industry and business sectors, the safety concerns behind the vulnerability of deep learning models need to be studied and addressed. 

 

This special session aims to bring together the current state-of-the-art research on Adversarial Machine Learning theories and applications. It targets to study and address a broad range of related issues from machine learning and cyber-security research areas. This special session also welcomes submission of application papers outlining related issues from industry and business perspectives.
